# Notes on TF

Brief notes on basic command usage in TensorFlow and their implementation in simple neural network models.

## üß† Overview

This repository contains introductory notes and code examples for using TensorFlow in basic machine learning workflows. The focus is on:

- Understanding core TensorFlow commands
- Implementing simple neural networks
- Using the Keras API for model creation, training, and evaluation

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To run the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow (v2.x)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
